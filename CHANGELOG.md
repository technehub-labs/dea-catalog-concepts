## [Unreleased]

### CR-CON-01: Authorship Cardinal Rule (R1, R2) - Org-Wide Propagation Slice

User directive 2026-10-13: "no `Coder` / `Agent` / agent or tool names in any
authorship field of any published artifact". The CR-BP-118 cardinal rules (R1
and R2) are propagated to this repo. New blocking gate
`scripts/check_authorship.py` (CR-BP-118 / AUT-001..003), data-driven from
`reconciliation/authorship-fields.yaml` (allowlist
`{Emmanuel A. Otchere, TechNeHub Labs}`; denylist
`{Coder, Agent, Hermes, Claude, GPT, Cline, OpenAI, MiniMax, MiniMax-M3}`).
The repo's authorship-bearing field set is identical to the 118a baseline
(`**Owner**`, `**Author**` in `change-requests/CR-*.md`); no per-repo
extension is needed. CI wiring: new workflow
`.github/workflows/validate-authorship.yml` runs the gate in `--strict` mode
on every push and PR. 21/21 `test_check_authorship` pass. Carrier:
`change-requests/CR-CON-01-authorship-cardinal-rule.md`.
